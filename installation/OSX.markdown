# OSX - Setting up your Dev Environment
-
In this document, we're going to condense how you should setup your machine in preparation for the rest of the tutorials contained in this document. Running OpenMined means having several different applications and repositories correctly installed and ready to work together, which can have unique challenges for each system. To that end, let's get your Mac up and running!!!

# Step 1: Install Unity

The longest part of the process is downloading the Unity3d video game engine (because it's a rather large file). Proceed to the [Unity3d Download Page](https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal) to download the Installer. While you wait for the download, you can continue with the other steps in this tutorial.

A few quick tips:

* You only need the Free version in order to use OpenMined
* Unity will start with your internet turned off, but if you have your internet turned on but are simply attached to a bad connection, sometimes Unity will hang. Just turn off your Wifi and restart Unity if you have this issue.
